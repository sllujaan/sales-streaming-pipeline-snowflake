# Real-Time Data Pipeline and Warehouse for Sales Using Snowflake

This project demonstrates a comprehensive real-time data warehouse solution for processing and analyzing incoming sales data from raw files.

## Project Overview

This project provides solutions for:

1. **Streaming Data Pipelines**: Efficiently processing and transforming incoming sales data in real-time.
2. **Data Warehouse**: Storing and managing the processed data for efficient querying and analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the stored data to derive meaningful insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. **Snowflake**: Utilized for Streaming to handle real-time data processing.
2. **SQL**: Employed for querying and managing data within the data warehouse.

## ETL Life Cycle

The project implements the full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) life cycle:

1. **Extract**: Raw sales data is ingested from various sources.
2. **Transform**: Data is processed and transformed in real-time using Snowflake Streaming.
3. **Load**: Transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse for storage and further analysis.

This project showcases an end-to-end solution for real-time data warehousing, ensuring that sales data is processed, stored, and analyzed efficiently.
